🎁 Sui Lucky Red Envelope
A fun and gamified red envelope (lucky money) dApp built on the Sui blockchain.

Users can deposit SUI tokens to create a red envelope. Others can pay to open the envelope and receive a random amount of tokens, which may be more or less than they paid — adding a thrill of luck and risk.
